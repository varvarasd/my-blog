//- Since this file, "index.pug" is located in src/contact, to get the correct
    path to the "main" layout, we'll use .. to go up one folder, into src,
    followed by "_layout", the name of the folder and "main", the name of the
    file.
    Note: we do not need to use the file extension ".pug" as it is optional to
    add it. Feel free to use it if you consider it makes more sense to you.
